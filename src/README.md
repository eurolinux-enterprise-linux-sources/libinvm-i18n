#libinvm-i18n

libinvm-i18n is a framework library for Internationalization, supporting a subset
of Internationalization (I18n) functionality. 

GNU Make is used to build for Linux and Windows.
As such we recommend mingw_w64 and msys be used to build in a windows
environment. Both of which can be found at mingw.org
